# Photon S File Converter
file converter for .photon, .photons, .pws and .cbddlp
full support for AA (if the format supports it) and preview. 

preview images get replaced by something arbitrary currently as scaling between the different sizes is not implemented yet.

The converter uses an internal format that can easily be used with other js projects for impoert/export

with some input from Rob2048's photon file import script.
